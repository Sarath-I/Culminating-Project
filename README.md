Employee Data Analysis — ABC Company

This repository presents a professional, end-to-end analysis of an employee dataset from ABC Company (458 records, 9 columns). The project transforms raw HR data into clear, actionable insights by applying careful data cleaning, structured exploratory analysis, and concise visual storytelling. Key tasks include correcting inconsistent fields, grouping employees by team and position, identifying the dominant age cohort, measuring team and role salary expenditures, and investigating the relationship between age and salary. All results are supported by reproducible code in a well-documented Jupyter Notebook and by clear visualizations that make the findings easy to interpret and share.

Dataset summary: 458 rows × 9 columns — employee attributes such as age, position, team, salary, and height.

Data cleaning: Standardized formats, handled missing values, and replaced inconsistent height entries with validated values (range 150–180) to ensure analysis accuracy.

Feature validation: Checked for outliers, corrected data types, and ensured consistent categorical labels for teams and positions.

Team distribution: Calculated counts and percentage distribution of employees across all teams to reveal workforce composition.

Position breakdown: Segregated employees by role to highlight staffing levels and role concentration.

Age group analysis: Determined the predominant age group and reported age-group percentages to profile workforce demographics.

Salary analysis: Measured total and average salary expenditure by team and by position to identify highest-cost areas.

Correlation check: Examined the relationship between age and salary using correlation metrics and visual confirmation (scatter plot with trend line).

Visualizations included: Bar charts, pie charts, histograms, box plots, scatter plots, and heatmaps — each chosen to best present the specific insight.

Key insights: Clear, data-backed observations on workforce structure, cost drivers, and demographic trends that can inform HR planning and budget decisions.
